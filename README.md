## Tenative Course Schedule 

[Course Webpage](https://resteorts.github.io/teach/bayes21.html)

The course webpage is meant to be a place such that you don't have to interact with github unless you choose to. The goal is that nearly all course materials should be accessible from this one place. 

[Cheat Sheet to Course](https://github.com/resteorts/modern-bayes/blob/master/syllabus/deadlines-cheatsheat.pdf)

This has summary information regarding the course times, labs, OH, hw deadlines, and exam dates. In addition, this has all the zoom codes you need as a reference guide. 

An introductory video of the course webpage can be found here: https://github.com/resteorts/modern-bayes/blob/master/intro-to-webpage/intro-to-webpage.mp4?raw=true

The syllabus is a comprehensive place regarding expectations for STA 360. 

[Syllabus](https://github.com/resteorts/modern-bayes/blob/master/syllabus/syllabus-sta602-spring-22.pdf)


Sakai will be used so you can see your grades throughout the semester. Homework submissions will be uploaded here on Sakai as well.

# Suggested Readings

## Hoff

I suggest that you read all of Hoff and you will be expected to have read the readings that correspond with the notes before 
coming to class. There are also notes that I have written under readings/ that you may find helping as additional resources. 

## Required Material

Before starting the course for the fall semester, I would highly recommend review the pre-req material for the course on the [syllabus](https://github.com/resteorts/modern-bayes/blob/master/syllabus/syllabus-sta360-fall20.pdf). Given the shortened semester, please make sure that you are 100 percent comfortable with the pre-req material before taking STA 360. If you have any questions regarding this, please reach out to me as soon as possible.
