\begin{enumerate}
\item 3.14, part d in Hoff. (Unit information prior). 
\item (Normal-Normal)  Derive the posterior predictive density $p(x_{n +1}|x_{1:n})$ for the Normal--Normal model covered in lecture. Hint: There is an easy way to do this and a hard way. To make the problem easier, consider writing $X_{n+1} = \btheta + Z$ given $x_{1:n}$, where $Z\sim\N(0,\lambda^{-1})$.)
\item Work through section 10.3 in the Hoff book. (Metropolis). 
\item Go through Labs 4--6.
\item (Monte Carlo and the inverse CDF method) 
Suppose we wish to sample from the conditional distribution of $X\mid X<c$, where $X\sim\N(0,1)$ and $c\in \R$. You may assume the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item you can generate $\Uniform(0,1)$ random variables, and 
    \item you can evaluate both the c.d.f.\ $F(x)$ and the inverse c.d.f.\ $F^{-1}(u)$ of the $\N(0,1)$ distribution.
\end{itemize}
How would you draw samples from $X\mid X<c$?
\end{enumerate}
