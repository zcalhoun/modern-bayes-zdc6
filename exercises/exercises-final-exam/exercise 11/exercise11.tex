%\subsection*{Instructions}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \textbf{Don't look at the solution yet!} This is for your benefit.
%\item This exercise must be submitted within 48 hours of the lecture in which it was given. 
%\item As long as you do the exercise on time, you get full credit---your performance does not matter.
%\item Without looking at the solution, take 5 minutes to try to solve the exercise.
%\item Pre-assessment: Write down how correct you think your answer is, from 0 to 100\%.
%\item Post-assessment: Now, study the solution and give yourself a ``grade'' from 0 to 100\%.
%\item Submit your work on the course website, including the pre- and post- assessments.
%\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Exercise}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the multivariate normal density $\N(x|\mu,C)$?
    \item Suppose $X,Y$ are two real-valued random variables.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What is the formula for the covariance $\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)$?
        \item What is the formula for the correlation $\rho(X,Y)$?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Suppose you can generate $\N(0,1)$ random variables. Give an explicit formula for generating a sample from $\N(\mu,C)$ where $C=A A^\T$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}\scriptsize
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
    $$\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}|C|^{1/2}}\exp\big(-\tfrac{1}{2}(x-\mu)^\T C^{-1} (x-\mu)\big)$$
\item
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y) = \E(XY) - \E(X)\E(Y) = \E\big((X-\E X)(Y-\E Y)\big)$
    \item $\rho(X,Y) = \mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)/(\sigma(X)\sigma(Y))$
\end{enumerate}
\item If $Z_1,\ldots,Z_d\iid\N(0,1)$ and $Z = (Z_1,\ldots,Z_d)^\T$, then $A Z + \mu \sim \N(\mu,A A^\T)$.
