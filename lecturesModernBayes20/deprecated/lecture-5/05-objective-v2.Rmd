A ``flat" prior
===

Let's talk about what people really mean when they use the term ``flat," since it can have different meanings.
\vskip 1em

Often statisticians will refer to a prior as being flat, when a plot of its density actually looks flat, i.e., uniform. 

$$\theta \sim \text{Unif}(0,1).$$

\vskip 1em

Why do we call it flat? It's assigning equal weight to each parameter value. Does it always do this?

Uniform(0,1) prior

Uniform(0,1) prior (continued)
===

What happens if we consider though the transformation to $\phi = 1/\theta.$ 

Is our prior still flat (does it place equal weight at every parameter value)?


Uniform prior versus the Transformed Prior

     \caption{Comparison of the Uniform prior and the transformed prior on $\theta.$ Observe that the figure on the right is very informative under the transformative, and thus, prior is extremely informative.}

Non-informative priors
===

We must be careful with the notion of non-informative priors as they can be quite informative as we have just illustated with a very simple example .
