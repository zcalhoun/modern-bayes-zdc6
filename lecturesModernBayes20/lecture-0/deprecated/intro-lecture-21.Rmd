## What is Bayesian Statistics?

*"Bayesian statistics is a theory in the field of statistics based on the Bayesian interpretation of probability where probability expresses a degree of belief in an event. The degree of belief may be based on prior knowledge about the event, such as the results of previous experiments, or on personal beliefs about the event. This differs from a number of other interpretations of probability, such as the frequentist interpretation that views probability as the limit of the relative frequency of an event after many trials. </font>."*

## Unstable/slow internet?

Go to [https://github.com/resteorts/modern-bayes/](https://github.com/resteorts/modern-bayes/) and fork the repository. 

- The videos are compressed, and this was done on purpose for those in the class that might have slow internet. I would suggest that everyone forks the repository to avoid any issues. 

- Verify that you can play them (otherwise install something on your machine). 

- Make sure to pull the repository each day. I update the repository very often as all the course resources are here (homeworks, lectures, data, videos). If you don't pull often, you might run into some issues!

--

- <font class="vocab">Labs</font>: **Attending lab is highly encouraged**, and, there will be a lab problem on each homework each week. 

- <font class="vocab">Class/Lab</font>: **You will be responsible for keeping up with all class and lab material on a weekly basis (even though there are recordings)!**

---

## Lab Engagement 

0. Students are expected to have attempted the lab solutions before coming to lab and have watched the lab videos provided if they had trouble. 
1. Students are encouraged to post lab questions in advance to the Google group regarding lab, which should be posted no later than each Thursday at 5 PM EST. 
2. Each lab TA will go over all lab tasks, providing clarifications, solutions/advice, and more advanced insights. 
3. Each lab TA will take questions (in person) or go over those posted to the Google group or via email. 
4. You should always indicate what lab you are in on the Google group. You can also reach out to Olivier for his lab at olivier.binette@gmail.com and to Michael at michael.f.christensen@duke.edu
5. Attendance is highly encouraged in order to learn tips and tricks and in order to get hints/advice which are important for homeworks and exams.

---

## Class Engagement

0. Students are expected to have read the assigned reading before coming to class. 
1. Students are expected to have watched the pre-recorded videos. 
2. Prof. Steorts will go through the concepts in class again, highlighting the most important parts, providing clarifications, solutions/advice, and more advanced insights. 
3. Prof. Steorts will take questions (in person) or those that are posted in advance on the Google Group by Monday at 10 AM EST and Wed at 10 AM EST. 
4. Prof. Steorts will provide exercises for the class to work through, practice exams, and an interactive environment. 
5. TAs will be present to help in these activities such that we can break into small groups and students can receive more individualized attention. 



--

- <font class="vocab">Exams</font>: Two exams. 

--

- <font class="vocab">Final Exam</font>: You must take the final exam to pass the course. 

---

## Homeworks

1. All code must be written to be reproducible in Markdown. 
2. All derivations can be done in any format of your choosing (word, latex, markdown, written by hand) but must be converted to a pdf document. It must be legible.
3. All files must be zipped together and submitted to Sakai as one file (including Rmd and pdf). Your pdf document must be uploaded to Duke GradeScope. Please make sure to upload early to avoid issues. 
4. Ask questions early if you have a problem to a TA regarding submission issues. 
5. Your lowest homework will be dropped. 
6. The first two homeworks can be submitted in Sakai and on GradeScope. 

Remark: Sakai is for reproducible code. Gradescope is to make grading easier for everyone. Unfortunately, there is not a platform that handles both.  

**Please see the syllabus for all homework guidelines.**

---

## Why Sakai + Gradescope?

1. Sakai will be used for reproducibility so this can be checked. This will account for 

2. Gradescope will be used to:

-  return homework/exams more promptly
- ensure  complete  fairness
- allow  students  to  continue  to  learn  from  homeworks  by  reworking problems  without  the  right  answer  written  out  to  the  side

---

## Exam 1

Exam 1 will be an **in class exam** with two offerings depending on your time zone.

- There will be two exams given. The first exam will be for international students (Vietnam, China, India) between 8:00 AM -- 9:15 AM EST. The second exam will be during the class period. 
- Students will have 30 minutes after the exam ends to upload their solutions (in one .pdf) to Gradescope. 
- During this time period, you are not to discuss the exam with anyone except the TA's and myself. 
- The exam is closed note and closed book. 


---

## Exams (Continued)

1. The exam will be over zoom and will be recorded. You will be required to have your videos on while working and sign an honor pledge that you have not looked at any online resources, books, notes, etc. 

2. The exam will be released via Duke Gradescope. 

3. You will have 30 minutes to post your written solutions to Duke Gradescope in one .pdf. 

4. You must have a note from your dean in order to be excused from an exam. There will be no make up exams, and all weight will move to the final exam in the case of an excused absense (such as a medical excuse). 

5. Students will not discuss exam material (on either exam) until the exam grades are released back to the students. 

Remark: The goal of these exams is to test your baseline knowledge of the course and not be stressful. Make sure you have a quiet place on the day of the exam during the class period.

## Grade Calculation

<small>

| Component | Weight |
|---------------|--------|
| Homework | 30%|
| Exam 1 | 20% |
| Exam 2 | 20% |
| Final Exam | 30% |

--

- See the syllabus for grade breakdowns. 
- Grades will **never** be curved down. 
- You are expected to attend lectures and labs in order to keep up with the course material. - - There will be no attendance grade or participation grade. 


</small>

---

## Excused Absences

- Students who miss a class due to a scheduled varsity trip, religious holiday, or short-term illness should fill out the respective form.
     - These excused absences do not excuse you from assigned work. 
--
- If you have a personal or family emergency or chronic health condition that affects your ability to participate in class, please contact your academic deanâ€™s office.
--

- Exam dates cannot be changed and no make-up exams will be given. 

---

## Late Work &amp; Regrade Requests

- No late homeworks will be accepted, so please do not ask.  
    
- No make up exams will be given.  

- Regrade requests must be submitted within one week of when the assignment was returned. 

---

## Academic Honesty

All work for this class should be done in accordance with the Duke Community Standard. 

> To uphold the Duke Community Standard:
> - I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
> - I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
> - I will act if the Standard is compromised.
Any violations will automatically result in a grade of 0 on the assignment and will be reported to [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct) for further action.

---

## Reusing Code

- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must or explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.

- On individual assignments, you may discuss the assignment with one another; however, you may not directly share code or write up with other students. 

- On team assignments, you may not directly share code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved. 

---

## Where to find help

- **If you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it!** There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.

--

- **Office Hours**: A lot of questions are most effectively answered in-person, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!

--

- **Google group**: Outside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on Google since there are likely other students with the same questions.

---

## Technology/Other

- Make sure that you have your zoom ids organized so that you're not late for class. 
- Ensure the volume on all devices is set to mute.
- Refrain from engaging in activities not related to the class discussion. Browsing the web and social media, excessive messaging, playing games, etc. is not only a distraction for you but is also a distraction for everyone around you.
- If you have a question, I don't mind if you interupt me during class. 
- If you find a **typo in the slides**, please write these down and email these to myself and Olivier so they can be fixed. 

---
